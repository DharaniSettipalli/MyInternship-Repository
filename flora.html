               <p><em>A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears.There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies.Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</em></p>

            <div class="col-10 col-lg-10 mb-5 mb-md-0">
               <p><em>Tulips (Tulipa) form a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes (having bulbs as storage organs). The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colors). They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae. There are about 75 species, and these are divided among four subgenera. The name "tulip" is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to resemble. Tulips originally were found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalised and cultivated (see map). In their natural state they are adapted to steppes and mountainous areas with temperate climates. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.</em></p>

               <p><em>Lotus is a type of floating aquatic plant of the genus Nelumbo. It is also known as Indian lotus because it represents a national flower of India. Lotus originates from southern parts of Asia and Australia, but it can be found in aquatic cultures throughout the world today. Lotus lives in shallow and murky ponds and lakes that are exposed to direct sunlight. It cannot survive in colder climates. Lotus is a symbol of beauty, grace, purity and serenity. Since this plant is numerous both in the wild and in the culture, it is not on the list of endangered plants.Lotus can reach only 49 inches in height but it spreads 10 feet horizontally (width).Flower opens in the morning and closes at night. Lotus was a symbol of sun, rebirth and creation in the ancient Egypt because of this unusual behavior which marks the beginning and the end of the day.Lotus uses rhizomes to attach itself to the ground. Rhizome is buried in the mud or in the sandy floor.Dried pod of lotus flower is very decorative and often used in floral arrangements. Petals are also used in ornamental purposes.</em></p>

               <p><em>The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a living annual plant in the family Asteraceae, with a large flower head (capitulum). The stem of the flower can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30 cm wide. Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which has a burgundy (red + purple) flower head.The flower head is actually an inflorescence made of hundreds or thousands of tiny flowers called florets. The central florets look like the centre of a normal flower, apseudanthium. The benefit to the plant is that it is very easily seen by the insects and birds which pollinate it, and it produces thousands of seeds.The sunflower is the state flower of Kansas. That is why Kansas is sometimes called the Sunflower State. To grow well, sunflowers need full sun. They grow best in fertile, wet, well-drained soil with a lot of mulch. In commercial planting, seeds are planted 45 cm (1.5 ft) apart and 2.5 cm (1 in) deep.</em></p>

           <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-10 col-lg-10 mb-5 mb-md-0">
               <p><em> Dahlia is a genus of bushy, tuberous, herbaceous perennial plants native to Mexico and Central America. A member of the Asteraceae (formerly Compositae) family of dicotyledonous plants, its garden relatives thus include the sunflower, daisy, chrysanthemum, and zinnia. There are 42 species of dahlia, with hybrids commonly grown as garden plants. Flower forms are variable, with one head per stem; these can be as small as 5 cm (2 in) diameter or up to 30 cm (1 ft) ("dinner plate"). This great variety results from dahlias being octoploids—that is, they have eight sets of homologous chromosomes, whereas most plants have only two. In addition, dahlias also contain many transposons—genetic pieces that move from place to place upon an allele—which contributes to their manifesting such great diversity.The stems are leafy, ranging in height from as low as 30 cm (12 in) to more than 1.8–2.4 m (6–8 ft). The majority of species do not produce scented flowers. Like most plants that do not attract pollinating insects through scent, they are brightly colored, displaying most hues, with the exception of blue.</em></p>
